# Patient Clinc System DataBase

•  Developed a program in C++ which maintains the medical records for all the patients of the clinic to allow efficient data access, designed the data collection as an ADT class
•  Implemented the ADT classes using a static array that expanded in a transparent fashion, which can modify sections of ADT without changing the public interface of the data
•  Effectively organized the database structure by programming reusable functions to maximize efficiency and conducted the corresponding debugging tests to ensure specifications
